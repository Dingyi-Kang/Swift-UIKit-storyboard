when you fetch change in xcworkSpace, you have to reopen the xcworkSpace/xcode

## open the Xcode version vs open the version in Disk when pulling changes

### this is the common issue when pulling changes in xcworkSpace
the version in Xcode is the version running your IDE now

The verison in DISK is the version you pull from xcworkSpace

If you choose open the verion in Disk, the Xcode will reopen.
